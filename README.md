# Project Codes Repository

Welcome to my collection of project codes! This repository contains a mix of fully developed and under-development projects and code snippets that I have worked on. The projects here cover a range of topics, including robotics, computer vision, path planning, and more.

## Projects

### 1. **Grid Navigation**
   - **Description**: This project implements several path planning algorithms for an agent navigating a grid with obstacles. The algorithms used include A* (A-star), D*, Dijkstra, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Q-learning. The performance of these algorithms is compared to determine the most efficient approach under different conditions.
   - **Competencies Used**: Python, Matplotlib, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization Algorithms, Path Planning, Algorithm Design, Data Visualization

### 2. **Jump Detection Using Computer Vision**
   - **Description**: A Python script that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect when a person jumps by tracking ankle positions.
   - **Competencies Used**: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Computer Vision

### 3. **Path Planning in ROS2**
   - **Description**: This project implements several path planning algorithms for the TurtleBot3 burger robot in Gazebo (Simulation) and in the real world. The algorithms used include A* (A-star), D*, Dijkstra, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The selection of the algorithm is facilitated using ROS2 parameters.
   - **Competencies Used**: ROS 2, Python, LIDAR, Path Planning, Gazebo Simulation, Optimization Algorithms

### 4. **TurtleBot3 Navigation**
   - **Description**: This project includes code for TurtleBot3 navigation, used for personal learning and experimentation. The implementations are basic and aim to familiarize myself with ROS2, robot motion control, and other related concepts.
   - **Competencies Used**: ROS 2, C++, Robot Motion Control, Obstacle Avoidance, Multi-Robot Navigation, Formation Control
