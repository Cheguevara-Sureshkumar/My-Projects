# Project Codes Repository

Welcome to my collection of project codes! This repository is a collection of various projects and code snippets that I have worked on. The projects here are a mix of fully developed and under-development projects.


## Projects

### 1. **Leader-Follower Controller**
   - **Description**: A control system where one robot follows another. The follower adjusts its speed and direction to maintain a specified distance and alignment with the leader.
   - **Technologies Used**: ROS 2, C++, Robot Odometry, Control Theory

### 2. **Obstacle Avoidance**
   - **Description**: A simple obstacle avoidance algorithm that uses laser scan data to control robot movement and avoid obstacles in its path.
   - **Technologies Used**: ROS 2, C++, LIDAR, Sensor Fusion

### 3. **Draw Circle Motion**
   - **Description**: A basic application that drives a robot in a circular path using linear and angular velocity commands.
   - **Technologies Used**: ROS 2, C++, Robot Motion Control

### 4. **Jump Detection Using Computer Vision**
   - **Description**: A Python script that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect when a person jumps by tracking ankle positions.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Computer Vision

## Setup and Installation

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- **ROS 2** (any compatible distribution like Foxy, Galactic, Humble, etc.)
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., `g++` for Linux or MinGW for Windows)
- **Python** (for Python-based projects, such as Jump Detection)
- **OpenCV** (for Python-based projects)
- **MediaPipe** (for Python-based projects)

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
